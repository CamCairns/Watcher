See jobs.yml for proper configuration syntax

Dependencies: python, python-pyinotify

In Ubuntu (and Debian):

sudo apt-get install python python-pyinotify python-yaml # thanks to Yoann Queret for pointing out python-yaml


make sure watcher.py is marked as executable

chmod +x watcher.py


start the daemon with:

./watcher.py start


stop it with:

./watcher.py stop


restart it with:

./watcher.py restart


The first time you start it (if you haven't done it yourself) it will create ~/.watcher and
~/.watcher/jobs.yml and then it will yell at you.  You need to edit ~/.watcher/jobs.yml to
setup folders to watch.  You'll find a jobs.yml in the same directory as this README.  Use
that as an example.  It should be pretty simple

If you edit ~/.watcher/jobs.yml you must restart the daemon for it to reload the configuration
file.  It'd make sense for me to set up watcher to watch the config file.  That'll be coming
soon.
